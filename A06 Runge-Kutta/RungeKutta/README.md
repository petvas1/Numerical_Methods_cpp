# Runge-Kutta Solver for Second-Order ODEs  

This C++ program solves **second-order differential equations** using the **Runge-Kutta (RK4) method**.  
It models a damped harmonic oscillator with angular frequency `ω` and damping factor `γ`.  
The program iterates over time, computing position and velocity, and saves the results in `data.dat`.
