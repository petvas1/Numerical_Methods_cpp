# Random Number Statistics  

This C++ program generates random numbers using the `xoroshiro128` algorithm and computes statistical properties.  
It estimates the mean and variance of summed random values and calculates the standard error.  
The program also constructs a probability distribution histogram of the sums.  
Results are saved in `gauss.dat` for further analysis.
