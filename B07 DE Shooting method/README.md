# Harmonic Oscillator Simulation

This C++ program solves the harmonic oscillator differential equation \(y'' + \omega^2 y = 0\) using the Runge-Kutta method. It calculates the system's behavior for different angular frequencies (\(\omega\)) in the range [0, 50] and writes the results to `data.dat`.
