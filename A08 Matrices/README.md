# Matrix Inversion and Charge Density Calculation

This C++ program calculates the charge density for a system of linear equations. It uses Gauss-Jordan elimination to invert a matrix and solves a system of equations. The program then computes the density and writes the results to a file (`data.dat`). The system of equations is generated with a specific matrix structure, and the density values are normed and stored for visualization or further analysis.

## Key Features:
- Matrix inversion using Gauss-Jordan elimination.
- Calculation of charge densities from the system of equations.
- Saving the results to a `data.dat` file for analysis.
