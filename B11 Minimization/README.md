# Root Finding Algorithm

This C++ program uses a modified version of the secant method to find the root of the function \( f(x) = \sin^2(\pi x) \) in the interval [0.2, 23.6]. The algorithm iteratively refines guesses until the error is below a specified threshold, and the results are saved in `data.dat`.
