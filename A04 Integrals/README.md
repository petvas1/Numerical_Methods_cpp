# Gaussian Integration with Legendre Polynomials  

This C++ program performs numerical integration using **Gaussian quadrature** with **Legendre weights and zeros**.  
It allows integration over finite and infinite intervals using a weighted summation approach.  
As an example, the program computes the **error function (`erf(x)`) and complementary error function (`erfc(x)`)**.  
Results for this example are saved in `erfx.dat`.
